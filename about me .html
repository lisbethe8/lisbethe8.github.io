	<h2>About Me </h2>
	<P>I'm a 16 (almost 17 in Nov 4) yr old with not much to my name. I'm still undecided for a career but I know that I'll find it eventually. I have this habbit of creating a ficitonal story in my mind and writing it down for any future projects I might want to work on with them. I read and play video games during my free time to pass time. My hobbies sometimes depend on my mood whether I want to write, read, play, or even fan edit.</P>
